# BasicEquationCreations
<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This program create a polynomial that passes through each of the points you specify.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>The program reads from a file that contains a set of x and y points. The file is passed through as a command line argument.</p>
<p>The program then create a polynomial of degree n-1 where n is the amount of points you specified.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>I wanted to study and use more math in Computer Science.</p>
<p>This was the start of creating equations to fit a set of data.</p>
<p>This method is very inefficient as the equation it creates most likely will not represent to rate of change you expect and will likely produce very long equations even if it could be describe in a simple manner.</p>
<p>This method will however guarantee that all points will be in the final equation.</p>
